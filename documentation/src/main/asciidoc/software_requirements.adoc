= Software requirements for Snow Owl Server

== Introduction

This document lists the required set of software components necessary to run Snow Owl Server on the x86_64 platform. 
Components and the corresponding files to download are listed in the sections below.

== Components

=== Operating system

Snow Owl Server requires a *CentOS* or *Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server (RHEL)* release *6* installation. As of
2015-07-17, the latest available release for CentOS is http://wiki.centos.org/Manuals/ReleaseNotes/CentOS6.6[version 6.6].
We recommend starting with a minimal install using the ISO image named `CentOS-6.6-x86_64-minimal.iso` and adding packages
later, as required.

=== Database server software

Terminology contents are persisted using the *5.6* series of *MySQL Community Server*, downloadable from 
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/yum/[MySQL's yum repository]. Select "`Red Hat Enterprise Linux / Oracle Linux 6 
(Architecture independent), RPM package`" with name `mysql-community-release-el6-5.noarch.rpm` for download.

=== JDK

Snow Owl Server uses version *7* of the *Java SE Development Kit*; note that runtime checks in the core server component 
prevent it from starting on JDK 8. An installable archive of Critical Patch Update *79* can be downloaded from the 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html[JDK7 download page]. Select the 
"`Linux x64`" edition named `jdk-7u79-linux-x64.rpm`.

=== LDAP

Authentication and authorization of browsers, terminology editors, reviewers and administrators is performed through an 
*Apache DS* version *2.0* LDAP server. The package to install is located on the 
http://directory.apache.org/apacheds/download/download-linux-rpm.html[Download for Linux RPM Package] page.

Browsing and managing ApacheDS instances can be done through the *Apache Directory Studio* application. We recommend 
installing the latest release from the corresponding http://directory.apache.org/studio/downloads.html[Downloads page] 
on Apache's website.

=== Task tracking

When using Snow Owl's desktop client, terminology editing tasks can be tracked using *Bugzilla* version *3.6*. (Recent 
versions are not guaranteed to work correctly with client integration.) The archived download of Bugzilla can be found 
at https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/webtools/archived/bugzilla-3.6.13.tar.gz.

NOTE: Bugzilla requires Perl modules not included in CentOS repositories. See the 
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#How_can_I_use_these_extra_packages.3F[usage instructions] for the Extra Packages 
for Enterprise Linux (*EPEL*) project for adding the required yum repository.

=== Reasoners

Depending on the complexity of the ontology, you may need to use the FaCT{plus}{plus} reasoner, which relies on a native
library component to increase performance. A customized version of FaCT{plus}{plus} exists for Snow Owl, which requires
version *2.12* from the *GNU C Library (glibc)* to be present, which is already included in the OS distributions
described above.

Note that the downloadable release of the same reasoner is based on a different (newer) glibc version, which makes it 
unsuitable for use within Snow Owl on CentOS/RHEL 6.
